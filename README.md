# Support Vector Machine
In this project, I will try to predict the penguin's species from anatomical information using Python and Scikit-Learn.

# About the data

The original data contains data for 3 penguin species, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. This Data was collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman at the Palmer Station, Antarctica. The dataset I will be using is a curated subset of the raw dataset.
